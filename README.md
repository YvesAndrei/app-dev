## Favorite Movie
Name: Pacific Rim
Things I ***love*** about it;
1. It has giant human powered mech suits. I am a fan of human powered suits like ironman, or the power armor in the fallout series. Having these huge mechanized suits really gets me happy and excited.
2. Monsters vs Humans setting. Stories where humans all work together when the fate of humanity is a cool concept to me. One day we're having wars with each other, the next we're all together working to fight a common enemy.
3. As a fan of the godzilla series, I like when huge monsters are in movies. Such an unrealistic, but entertaining plot point.

> Pacific Rim is underrated. Many people have not seen the movie and I recommend they do.
